<p>Oliver Carty & Family take a holistic approach to sustainability focussed on social,
environmental and economic stewardship. Its sustainability plan is an integral part of
its overall strategic plan, with a dedicated ‘Green Team’ focussing on initiatives across
the business. Throughout 2020, led by Bernie Carty, the Green Team championed
the reduction of waste levels. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic and an increase in use
of PPE general waste, there has been a decrease in waste overall with the company
ahead of target by 22% - initiatives included a move to more sustainable waste
suppliers, segregation of plastic waste in production, and reduction in packing raw
materials, leading to significant increase in recycling as opposed to land fill. Oliver
Carty & Family decreased waste by over 37 tonnes within a 12-month period, primarily
from a decrease in both recycled waste and Category 3 waste, demonstrating an
exemptional performance.</p>
